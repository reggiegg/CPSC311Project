Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project:

1.
Stack-based game that elucidates stack-based programming languages in Factor.

2.
AST domain-specific language for creating ASTs and Function Call Trees with static/dynamic eager/lazy scenarios.

3.
Create a parser that creates ASTs from musical scores! Then, it interprets it by playing music, yay!
