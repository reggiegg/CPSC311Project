% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

We are creating a substantial program in Factor; a programming language that none of us have studied. Factor is a stack-based programming language and we will be using it to make a game which helps to teach users about stack-based languages.

\section{Introduction}
We are looking to create a game which illustrates to players the
unique paradigm of concatenative languages. We intend to create
said game in Factor, which is itself a concatenative language.
This is no accident.

\section{The Game}
\subsection{How it Meets Project Requirements}\
We intend to create a fully featured interactive game. Concepts
pertaining to stack based, or concatenative, languages will be
illustrated through analogous gameplay. We have discussed the
idea of using the analogy of creating recipes to prepare various
forms of stack like food (think: hamburgers, sandwiches, pancakes).
Through this parallel players will manipulate ``recipes'' which are 
representative of the sequence of operation which manipulate a stack.
Through this manipulation they will create various types of food.

We chose Factor as our language of inquiry due to its unique qualities.
As a language it is heavily influenced by functional language concepts,
however, because it is stack-based it must present these concepts in a
different way. It forces the user to explore these concepts explicitly
and byy doing so it further ellucidates these ideas while
simultaneously exposing the user (us) to a new paradigm. 

Must be substantial

Language must be useful

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
% \section{Acknowledgments}
% This section is optional; it is a location for you
% to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
% what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
% authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
% his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
% and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
% \bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% \bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional
%\balancecolumns
% \appendix
% %Appendix A
% \section{Headings in Appendices}
% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
% the body of the article are different in the appendices.
% In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
% \textbf{section} is used to
% indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
% a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
% hierarchical structure
% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
% highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
% document in Appendix-appropriate form:
% \subsection{Introduction}
% \subsection{The Body of the Paper}
% \subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
% \subsubsection{Math Equations}
% \paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% \paragraph{Display Equations}
% \subsubsection{Citations}
% \subsubsection{Tables}
% \subsubsection{Figures}
% \subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
% \subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
% \subsection{Conclusions}
% \subsection{Acknowledgments}
% \subsection{Additional Authors}
% This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
% You just add the names and information in the
% \texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
% of the document.
% \subsection{References}
% Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
% then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
% to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
% the .tex source file and comment out
% the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% % This next section command marks the start of
% % Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
% \section{More Help for the Hardy}
% The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct
% and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
% experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
% it useful but please remember not to change it.
